Over the last decade, he has developed devices and founded several venture-backed companies in neurosurgery and sports safety, including: Aqueduct Neurosciences, an FDA-approved approach to treating hydrocephalus; and Vicis, a new helmet for contact sports like football and hockey, aiming to dramatically reduce the incidence of concussion. Vicis was named one of the Top 25 inventions of 2017 by Time Magazine and will be launched commercially in 2018. The idea for Proprio originated when Sam observed that the critical navigational imaging used in surgery could be revolutionized using novel technologies to dramatically improve visualization and reduce risk—and fundamentally transform the way that physicians and healthcare systems function to advance patient care. This led him to the Sensor Systems Lab and Joshua Smith, PhD, at the University of Washington, whose team led the creation of the light field imaging solutions at the heart of Proprio.","image":{"volumeId":"1","folderId":"3","folderPath":"","filename":"Sam-Browd.jpg","kind":"image","size":"179824","keptFile":null,"dateModified":"2019-08-08T01:20:33-07:00","newLocation":null,"locationError":null,"newFilename":null,"newFolderId":null,"tempFilePath":null,"avoidFilenameConflicts":false,"suggestedFilename":null,"conflictingFilename":null,"deletedWithVolume":false,"keepFileOnDelete":false,"id":"518","tempId":null,"draftId":null,"revisionId":null,"uid":"81afd094-70ac-4249-8769-b2d3607f467c","fieldLayoutId":null,"contentId":"414","enabled":"1","archived":"0","siteId":"1","enabledForSite":"1","title":"Sam Browd","slug":null,"uri":null,"dateCreated":"2019-08-08T01:20:33-07:00","dateUpdated":"2019-09-07T14:53:11-07:00","dateDeleted":null,"trashed":false,"propagateAll":false,"resaving":false,"duplicateOf":null,"previewing":false,"hardDelete":false,"hasDescendants":false,"ref":null,"status":"enabled","structureId":null,"totalDescendants":0,"url":"/images/Sam-Browd.jpg","extension":"jpg","focalPoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"hasFocalPoint":false,"height":"833","mimeType":"image/jpeg","path":"Sam-Browd.jpg","width":"1250"}},{"title":"James Youngquist, MSc","jobTitle":"Co-founder, Head of Engineering","descriptionFirst":"Jim Youngquist has researched topics in computer vision and robotics throughout his career.
