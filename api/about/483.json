He currently serves as the Medical Director of Seattle Children’s Concussion Program, teaches in both the UW Foster School of Business and the Department of Neurological Surgery, and is the Director of the Sports Institute at UW Medicine.","descriptionSecond":"Throughout his academic and clinical career, Sam has focused on need-based solutions, leading to collaborations with engineering colleagues who have been able to move physician ideas to real devices that scale medicine’s ability to profoundly impact patient’s lives. Over the last decade, he has developed devices and founded several venture-backed companies in neurosurgery and sports safety, including: Aqueduct Neurosciences, an FDA-approved approach to treating hydrocephalus; and Vicis, a new helmet for contact sports like football and hockey, aiming to dramatically reduce the incidence of concussion. Vicis was named one of the Top 25 inventions of 2017 by Time Magazine and will be launched commercially in 2018. The idea for Proprio originated when Sam observed that the critical navigational imaging used in surgery could be revolutionized using novel technologies to dramatically improve visualization and reduce risk—and fundamentally transform the way that physicians and healthcare systems function to advance patient care. This led him to the Sensor Systems Lab and Joshua Smith, PhD, at the University of Washington, whose team led the creation of the light field imaging solutions at the heart of Proprio.","image":{"volumeId":"1","folderId":"3","folderPath":"","filename":"Sam-Browd.jpg","kind":"image","size":"179824","keptFile":null,"dateModified":"2019-08-08T01:20:33-07:00","newLocation":null,"locationError":null,"newFilename":null,"newFolderId":null,"tempFilePath":null,"avoidFilenameConflicts":false,"suggestedFilename":null,"conflictingFilename":null,"deletedWithVolume":false,"keepFileOnDelete":false,"id":"518","tempId":null,"draftId":null,"revisionId":null,"uid":"81afd094-70ac-4249-8769-b2d3607f467c","fieldLayoutId":null,"contentId":"414","enabled":"1","archived":"0","siteId":"1","enabledForSite":"1","title":"Sam Browd","slug":null,"uri":null,"dateCreated":"2019-08-08T01:20:33-07:00","dateUpdated":"2019-09-07T14:53:11-07:00","dateDeleted":null,"trashed":false,"propagateAll":false,"resaving":false,"duplicateOf":null,"previewing":false,"hardDelete":false,"hasDescendants":false,"ref":null,"status":"enabled","structureId":null,"totalDescendants":0,"url":"/images/Sam-Browd.jpg","extension":"jpg","focalPoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"hasFocalPoint":false,"height":"833","mimeType":"image/jpeg","path":"Sam-Browd.jpg","width":"1250"}},{"title":"Kenneth Denman","jobTitle":"Co-Founder, Chairman of the Board","descriptionFirst":"Ken Denman is a vastly experienced technology CEO with executive, strategic and operational experience across software, artificial intelligence, wireless and enterprise applications.
